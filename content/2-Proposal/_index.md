## Academic Research Chatbot
### AWS RAG-based solution for smart academic support and research

#### 1. Executive Summary
**Academic Research Chatbot** is an AI assistant supporting academic research, helping students and lecturers search, summarize, and analyze scientific documents (PDFs, papers) through natural conversation with accurate source citations.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Core Technology**: Combines **IDP** (Amazon Textract) to process documents (including scans) and **RAG** (Amazon Bedrock - Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to generate intelligent responses.
- **Optimized Architecture**: Hybrid model using 1 EC2 t3.small combined with Serverless services (Amplify, Cognito, S3, DynamoDB) to balance performance and cost.
- **Feasibility**: Serves ~50 internal users with operating costs ~$60/month, fast deployment time (20 days), and maximizes AWS Free Tier.

#### 2. Problem Statement

**Current Problem**
Students and researchers have to work with a large number of academic documents (conference papers, journals, theses, technical reports). Many documents are old scanned PDFs (pre-2000), without a text layer, making searching for content, data, and tables very time-consuming.
Public AI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, NotebookLM, etc.) are not directly connected to the school/department's internal document repository, making it difficult to ensure security and access rights by subject or research group.
The current infrastructure lacks a unified access point to:
- Manage research documents by subject/topic.
- Allow researchers to ask questions directly on their own papers.
- Ensure answers have clear citations (paper, page, table, section).
**Consequence:** Researchers have to manually read, take notes, and copy data from multiple papers; lecturers find it difficult to quickly synthesize information when preparing lectures or topics; academic data is scattered across many personal machines, difficult to standardize and reuse.

**Solution**
**Academic Research Chatbot** proposes building an internal academic Q&A platform based on AWS, where:
1.  **Dev/Admin loads research document repository:**
    -   Upload PDFs to **Amazon S3**, metadata is stored in **Amazon DynamoDB**.
    -   An EC2 worker consumes the **Amazon SQS** queue, calls **Amazon Textract** to OCR, extract text, tables, forms, including scanned documents.
    -   Worker normalizes/chunks content, sends to **Amazon Bedrock Titan Text Embeddings v2** to generate embeddings, and indexes into **Qdrant** on EC2.
2.  **Researchers ask questions via web interface (Amplify + CloudFront):**
    -   Questions are embedded, querying Qdrant to retrieve the most relevant segments (Retrieval).
    -   These segments are passed to **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** on **Amazon Bedrock** to generate answers with accurate citations (paper, page, section, table) and explanations in academic context.
All access is protected by **Amazon Cognito** (researcher vs admin authorization), logs & metrics are monitored via **Amazon CloudWatch + SNS** (alerts on worker errors, queue backlog, high EC2 CPU).

**Benefits and ROI**
**Academic Efficiency:**
-   Reduces 40–60% of time researchers spend finding data, F1-scores, p-values, sample sizes, experimental equipment, or method descriptions from multiple papers.
-   Reduces citation errors due to forgetting pages/tables, as the chatbot always returns sources and locations.
**Internal Knowledge Management:**
-   Research documents are centralized in an S3 + DynamoDB repository, easy to backup, authorize, and expand.
-   Can be reused for many courses, topics, and labs without building a new system.
**Low & Controllable Infrastructure Costs:**
-   Hybrid model 1 EC2 + managed AI services keeps operating costs for 50 internal users at around < $50/month, mainly paying for EC2, 2–3 VPC endpoint interfaces, and Bedrock/Textract usage.
-   The system is designed to be deployed in about 20 days by a team of 4, suitable for a research/internship project but still has product architecture quality.
**Long-term Value:**
-   Creates a platform to later integrate learning behavior analysis dashboards, paper recommendation modules, or expand to multi-language and multi-field learning assistants.

#### 3. Solution Architecture

Academic Research Chatbot applies the AWS Hybrid RAG Architecture model with IDP (Intelligent Document Processing), combining a single EC2 (FastAPI + Qdrant + Worker) with managed AI services (Textract, Bedrock) to optimize costs while ensuring performance for about 50 internal users.

**Data Processing and Conversation Flow**

**AWS Services Used**
-   **Amazon Route 53:** DNS management for chatbot platform domain.
-   **Amazon CloudFront:** CDN distributing web interface (chat + admin) with low latency.
-   **AWS Amplify Hosting:** Hosts web application (React/Next) for Researchers and Dev/Admin.
-   **Amazon Cognito:** User authentication, researcher vs admin role management.
-   **Amazon S3:** Stores original PDF files uploaded by Dev/Admin (raw documents).
-   **Amazon SQS (doc_ingestion_queue):** Job queue for document processing.
-   **Amazon Textract:** IDP/OCR for scanned PDFs and digital PDFs.
-   **Amazon Bedrock:**
    -   **Titan Text Embeddings v2:** Generates embedding vectors for text chunks.
    -   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** Generates academic answers from context + user questions (RAG).
-   **Amazon DynamoDB:** Documents table: document metadata, pipeline status (UPLOADED, IDP_RUNNING, EMBEDDING_DONE, FAILED).
-   **Amazon EC2 (t3.small, private subnet):**
    -   Runs FastAPI backend (REST API for chat and admin).
    -   Runs Qdrant Vector DB to store and query embeddings.
    -   Runs Worker process consuming SQS, calling Textract + Titan, indexing into Qdrant, updating DynamoDB.
-   **VPC + ALB + VPC Endpoints:**
    -   VPC + private subnet for EC2 (not directly exposed to Internet).
    -   Application Load Balancer (ALB): entry point for all APIs from Amplify to EC2.
    -   Gateway Endpoint (S3, DynamoDB) and Interface Endpoint (Textract, Bedrock, SQS – if used) for EC2 to call AWS services without NAT Gateway.
-   **Amazon CloudWatch + Amazon SNS:**
    -   Collects logs and metrics from EC2, ALB, SQS.
    -   CloudWatch Alarms send alerts via SNS when CPU is high, SQS backlog, worker errors, etc.
-   **AWS CodePipeline / CodeBuild:** Automates build & deploy for backend (FastAPI on EC2).

**Component Design**
-   **Users:**
    -   **Researchers:** Q&A, academic content lookup.
    -   **Dev/Admin:** Upload, manage, and re-index documents.
-   **Document Processing (IDP):**
    -   PDFs uploaded by Dev/Admin to S3.
    -   Worker on EC2 calls Textract for OCR and text/table extraction.
-   **Indexing & Vector DB:**
    -   Worker normalizes, chunks content.
    -   Calls Bedrock Titan Embeddings v2 to create embeddings.
    -   Saves embeddings + metadata to Qdrant on EC2.
-   **AI Conversation (RAG):**
    -   FastAPI embeds question, queries Qdrant for top-k relevant segments.
    -   Sends context + question to Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Bedrock) to generate answer with citation.
-   **User Management:**
    -   Cognito authenticates and authorizes researcher / admin.
-   **Storage & State:**
    -   DynamoDB stores document metadata (doc_id, status, owner, …) and (optional) chat history.

-   Significantly reduce manual search time thanks to RAG + IDP technology.

**Long-term Value**
-   Build a digitized research platform for 50+ researchers, easily scalable.
-   Create a foundation for advanced features: Document recommendations, research trend analysis, and Literature Review support.
